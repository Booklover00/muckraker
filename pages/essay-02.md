## The Origins of Muckraking

Although the phrase “muckraker” was meant to be an insult, the men and women who often risked their lives to expose business and government corruption in the Progressive Era were less concerned with the labels society thrust upon them. Originally coined by Theodore Roosevelt in a speech in 1906, muckrakers were narrow-minded people that stood in the way of progress, according to him. But the reality was muckrakers were anything but narrow-minded. They worked tirelessly, often going undercover, to shine a light on the human ramifications of greed and corruption. They forced elite society to acknowledge parts of their great cities they would have preferred to ignore. In this way, muckrakers were the original investigative journalists, and ended up paving the way for future investigative reporters who appeared later on in the twentieth century.

The Gilded Age in America resulted in vast amounts of wealth among a select few, and business was taking on new forms in the shape of corporations. The rapid rise of industrialization fueled this great wealth, but it also formed a huge divide in the American population - the haves and have nots. The business world was akin to the wild west with few regulations and shady deals and liaisons between government and rich industrial titans. There was little concern for the working conditions of factory workers who toiled six days a week in unsafe conditions. Business became a religion, and if you weren’t heeding it, then you were just in the way. Either that, or you weren’t fit to run your own life, as was expressed clearly in Andrew Carnegie’s Gospel of Wealth. 

It’s not very surprising, then, to know that the Progressive Era brought about a massive shift in public perception of the economic inequalities they saw around them. The Panic of 1893 was another example to many ordinary citizens of what happens when too much power is held in the hands of a few. The laissez-faire attitude that had ruled the American economy for so long was slowly starting to crack. And it was the muckrakers who were ready with their pen and paper to document it. 

## The Jungle & Upton Sinclair

The mediums of documentation used by the muckrakers was not just limited to newspapers – they also used cartoons, poetry, and books, both fiction and non-fiction, to hold a mirror up to society. The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, for example, is a fiction novel about the dark side of Chicago’s meatpacking industry.[^1] Sinclair is considered one of the most famous muckrakers for his stark portrayal of the harsh life of working immigrants in an unforgiving city. Published in 1906, it shook readers to their very core with its revolting descriptions of rotting meat and filthy factories. Sinclair, who wrote for newspapers before The Jungle, treated preparation for the book much like a journalist might. Although he was writing fiction, he spent hours interviewing meatpacking workers in Chicago’s stockyards. For over a month, he lurked and observed the life of slaughterhouse workers until he had a razor-sharp comprehension of what he wanted to say.

The Jungle resulted in massive change, including the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act. In the letter above, Upton Sinclair wrote to Roosevelt showing his support for inspectors in the meat packing plants.

## Ida Tarbell & Standard Oil Company

Other muckrakers like Ida Tarbell were more traditional in their approach. Tarbell is now famous for her expose´ article series on Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company that was published in a magazine in 1902. She spent years in deep research on Standard Oil’s shady and questionable business practices. The series became so popular that it eventually turned into a book, The History of the Standard Oil Company. Tarbell had a personal motivation for targeting Rockefeller; growing up in the Pennsylvania oil fields, she witnessed the poverty and economic disaster that came from oil tycoons having too much control. The South Improvement Company in Pennsylvania had been Rockefeller’s early attempt at oil monopolization, and Tarbell remembered it well. Her work on Standard Oil eventually resulted in a 1911 Supreme Court ruling that Rockefeller’s company violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.

## Other Investigation Methods

In true undercover reporting fashion, muckrakers like Nellie Bly got herself committed to a mental asylum to get a firsthand experience of the terrible conditions there. She also worked in factories to report on the terrible condition workers suffered. Other notable muckrakers such as Lincoln Steffens traveled around, reporting on what they witnessed. Like Ida Tarbell, Steffens wrote for McClure’s Magazine, which was a popular publication at the time that focused on exposing “America’s ills.” Steffens reporting on city life eventually turned into a book called The Shame of the Cities. Through their writing and art, these men and women were indeed raking muck that was practically invisible to America’s wealthy upper classes. That “muck” included the desperation of poverty that feels inescapable no matter how hard you work. It also included the frivolous lives and spending habits of the super-rich and their willingness to turn a blind eye to those less fortunate. 


## Muckrakers Begin to Lose Their Appeal

Despite the many political and economic changes that resulted from muckrakers’ efforts including child labor laws, prison reform, and land conservation laws, the end of WWI marked the steady decline of muckraking as a social movement. A combination of changing public sentiment and a new political climate made muckrakers suddenly seem tiresome. People were tired of always hearing about the dark side of America, especially after living through WWI. Muckrakers themselves noticed a change in people’s willingness to listen and found themselves with limited options for publishing their work. An editor from Everybody’s magazine, once a popular outlet for muckrakers’ reporting, summed it up when he said: “The subject was not exhausted but the public interest therein seemed to be at an end, and inevitably the editors turned to other sources of copy to fill their pages.” The gradual decline of muckraking coincided with the First Red Scare, when a debilitating and oppressive political climate took hold of America in 1919. Fear of anarchy and revolution made any appearance of dissent a threat to national government. The hysteria over a Communist government takeover resulted in thousands of arrests, and radical reporting faded into silence. The muckrakers’ dwindling status would continue as future conflicts gripped the nation. WW2 resulted in a patriotic fervor that left no room for disunity, and the Cold War saw the merging of media outlets and government that created a formidable web of propaganda.

## The Cold War & Media Loyalty

After WW2, tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States reached a tipping point. Each side was wary of the other; the US feared Soviet expansion and the spread of Communism, while the Soviets were intent on expanding their influence. Far from being over, the fear of Communism in the US had taken on new and epic proportions through President Truman and McCarthyism in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Communism was now a threat to American prosperity, and new forms of media consumption helped solidify this notion in the public consciousness.

Once the territory of muckrakers like Tarbell and Sinclair, the traditional newspaper, magazine, and pamphlet was slowly replaced by TVs. This new form of information consumption forever altered the relationship between the public and media, and was the key instrument in spreading new propaganda campaigns. The Cold War created a form of patriotism verging on hysteria in America, and many broadcast companies and media outlets sided with the government in order to survive. Cooperation with government and ideas of American nationalism took hold; there was no place for the muckraking tendency of stirring up trouble. Many journalists now worked for large news corporations, and all were united in the common threat against Communism. 

In her book, U.S. Television News and Cold War Propaganda, Nancy Bernhard articulated this new relationship between the media and government agencies: “In the mid-twentieth century…the political economy of the mass media was intimately tied up with the articulation of Cold War policies, and objectivity became grounded in fervent anticommunism.” Whereas before independent journalism was used as a means of criticism against American politics, the cooperation between giant media companies and government agencies created a cohesive factory of anti-Communist ideas that served to facilitate American foreign policy objectives. 

Bernhard touches on this point when she says: “The Cold War made propaganda an integral part of American foreign policy and took as its casualty confidence that the United States would triumph in the marketplace of ideas.” The power of propaganda would continue to be used as a means of manipulation throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Media and journalism would continue to feel the pressure of cooperation with government, but it wasn’t until the turbulent 1970s that radical reporting took on similar characteristics that defined the early muckrakers.

## Muckrakers Make Their Comeback in the 1970s

Intense social and political unrest created a climate that made it possible for radical reporting to take center stage once again. With the same spirit of rebellion and scrutiny that characterized the muckrakers of the Progressive Era, investigative journalists of the 1970s worked diligently to expose both corporate and government corruption. A renewed sense of urgency in investigative reporting took hold, with many prominent papers creating their own distinct investigation units, such as the Boston Globe and Newsday. 

Television continued to play a role in information consumption, and the wildly popular TV show 60 Minutes from CBS is an example of the renewed desire for investigative news. While many of the early muckrakers toiled in obscurity to expose corruption, the investigative journalists of the 1970s took on something of a celebrity status. The 1970s was an era when investigative journalism transformed into a respected form of reporting and was considered essential to maintaining American democracy.


## Nixon & the Watergate Scandal

Perhaps one of the most defining moments of investigative journalism was the Watergate scandal in 1972. President Nixon was attempting to run for reelection, and his methods included a team of agents known as CREEP that used illegal tactics to discredit the Democratic party. When a team of five men were caught attempting to burglarize an office of the Democratic National Committee, what became known as the Watergate scandal quickly turned into a race among journalists to uncover the truth. 

Journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward from the Washington Post eventually exposed Nixon’s connection to the Watergate burglary thanks to the many information leaks they were given by an anonymous source known as “Deep Throat.” Their reporting uncovered a vast web of political corruption and sabotage orchestrated by the Nixon administration, which resulted in Nixon’s resignation as president in 1974.

## Brian Barger & The Iran-Contra Scandal 

The 1980s also saw its fair share of political scandal unveiled through investigative reporting. One of these was the Iran-Contra scandal that took place during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. In 1981, the CIA illegally formed and financially aided an army to overthrow the government of Nicaragua. Known as the “contras,” this CIA-funded army provoked a war that devastated Nicaragua economic stability. Even worse, it was later discovered that the Reagan administration had secretly funded the contras through illegal channels, and links were found to drug cartels in South America. It was seasoned investigative journalist Brian Barger who, along with reporter Robert Parry, played a key role in exposing the link between contra groups and the US government. Their published article contained witness testimony from both the contra armies and the Reagan administration that showed a clear connection to drug trafficking and illegal funding. Brian Barger had already made a name for himself as a reporter that covered the Columbian drug cartels and had an impressive career at the Washington Post.
